# Introduction

Hey there :wave:
This is the official GitHub repo for the Dungeons and Depths group. Here, we will keep track of our characters and world-building.

# Why GitHub? ðŸ¤”

I swear it's not bias. It's more about version control and tracking what changes happen as our campaign goes on. Also, this might be useful to other DnD players.

# What Do I Do?

So I know git and GitHub can be intimidating for newcomers. That's okay! I was there at one point. In essence, git is a command line tool that helps multiple people collaborate on a single project while simplifying revisions and conflicts. GitHub is a hosting "hub" where people can post projects. Others are able to contribute by submitting feedback, bugs, or anything else. This is called submitting an "issue".

For our project, we can take advantage of git and GitHub's powerful features to keep track of everything that goes on in the game. It'll remove a lot of the burden of constantly trying to resolve session conflicts regarding what is actually going on in the game. And as the DM, it'll give me a place where I can receive feedback about game system, game story, and other components.

# How Do I do This?

Here's a few resources to help you:
* If you aren't sure how to submit issues: [Check this out](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
* To learn about GitHub and how to use it, read this: [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) :octocat: .
* I know a good number of us are not too familiar with the commandline. Thankfully, GitHub released a tool that anyone can use! [Give it a download](https://desktop.github.com/)
* GitHub also uses the MarkDown language for styling documents. [Here is a reference sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

# How To Contribute
Here's the basic guide on how to contribute. Please check out ```CONTRIBUTING.md``` for a more detailed run-down of the requirements.

The current structure of this repo is a :warning: WIP :warning: so please bear with me if things change drastically.

As of right now, we have 3 different folders that will help us keep track of different components:
* Characters: Your character sheets go here.
* Worldbuilding: Anything related to lore. :warning: : This is subject to change. I'll probably add sub-folders for lore and other subcategories that fall under lore.
* Rulebook: This will contain a doc containing the rulebook of the game.
